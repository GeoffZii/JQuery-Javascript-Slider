NB: icomoon.css is nothing much but a css icons. its the one showing the left and right arrows and image thumbnails,
    you may choose to remove its okay.

NB: geoffslider.js is the actual jquery javascript that is processing / or making the slider happen . its the real deal
NB: geofslider.css is just css adding some styles for the page. you can ignore it. unless you understand it. just focus on the html and geoffslider.js to understand the slider.


NB:     i will be going to create video youtube tutorial soon to be uploaded on my channel 'Rectar Learns'. Look out for it. dont worry if you dont understand it.
